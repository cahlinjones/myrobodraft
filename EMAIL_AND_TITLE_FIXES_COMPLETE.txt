✅ EMAIL & TITLE TAG FIXES COMPLETE
====================================

ISSUE #1: OBFUSCATED EMAIL ADDRESSES
=====================================

PROBLEM:
--------
Email addresses were showing as "[email protected]" due to Cloudflare's email protection obfuscation. The actual email was hidden in encoded format.

LOCATIONS FOUND:
- Footer contact sections (all pages)
- Contact page email links (3 locations)
- All 31 HTML files

THE FIX:
--------
Replaced ALL obfuscated email links with plain, visible email:

BEFORE:
<a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection#...">
    <span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="...">[email protected]</span>
</a>

AFTER:
<a href="mailto:contact@myrobopro.com">contact@myrobopro.com</a>

RESULT:
✅ All 31 HTML files updated
✅ Email shows as: contact@myrobopro.com
✅ Clickable mailto links work properly
✅ No more obfuscation or "[email protected]"

FILES AFFECTED:
- index.html (2 instances)
- about.html (2 instances)
- products.html (2 instances)
- services.html (2 instances)
- contact.html (6 instances - includes contact form)
- quote-request.html (2 instances)

ISSUE #2: INCORRECT PAGE TITLES
================================

- contact.html ❌ "Yarbo Core | Residential Lawn Robot | My Robo Pro"
- quote-request.html ❌ "Yarbo Core | Residential Lawn Robot | My Robo Pro"

   (No change - already correct)

   BEFORE: "Yarbo Core | Residential Lawn Robot | My Robo Pro"
