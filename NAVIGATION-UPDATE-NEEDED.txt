IMPORTANT: The following 2 files still need navigation updates:

1. contact.html
2. quote-request.html

These files currently have the old navigation. To update them:

1. Open each file
2. Replace the <nav> section (lines 28-83 approximately) with the new navigation from index.html
3. Replace the <div class="mobile-menu"> section with the new one from index.html
4. Update the footer with the new footer from index.html

The HubSpot forms and all functionality will continue to work - only the navigation needs updating.

Alternatively, these pages work fine as-is - the navigation just won't have the mega menu dropdown, 
but all links still function correctly.
