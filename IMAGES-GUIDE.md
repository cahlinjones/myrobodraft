3. Size: 600x400px minimum

#### Option 2: Add Real Product Photos
For each product, ideally you want:
- 1 main image: `images/[product-name]-main.jpg` (800x600px)
- 4 thumbnail images: `images/[product-name]-1.jpg` through `-4.jpg` (200x200px)

**Where to get product images:**
1. Manufacturer websites
2. Your phone (if you have the products)

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start Simple:** Use placeholders for launch, add real images over time

2. **Consistency:** Use similar lighting/style for all product images

3. **Optimization:** Always compress images before uploading (use TinyPNG.com)

4. **Alt Text:** Images already have descriptive alt text in the HTML

5. **Mobile:** Images automatically resize for mobile - no separate images needed

6. **Updates:** You can replace images anytime without changing HTML (just use same filename)

## 🆘 Quick Fixes

**If an image doesn't load:**
1. Check the filename matches exactly (case-sensitive)
2. Verify the image is in the /images directory
3. Try clearing your browser cache
4. Check file extension (.jpg vs .jpeg)

**If images look pixelated:**
1. Original image is too small
2. Resize to at least the recommended dimensions
3. Save at higher quality setting

**If images are too large (slow loading):**
1. Resize to recommended dimensions (no need for huge files)
2. Compress with TinyPNG.com
3. Convert PNG to JPG (for photos)
